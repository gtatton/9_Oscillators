9 Oscillators
performance by prof. Guido Tattoni for Hong Kong Design Institute
may 11th 2021

This Patcher is the performace itself, it was designed for a single use only and to be operated by no one bu the author himself.
As it was not intended for distribution, it lacks any instruction, explanation or user interface apart from what you see.

I was asked to release it, so please take it as it is, no expectations. Anyone can download it and make whatever they want with it, I hope you enjoy it.

I will be happy to see what people do so you can let me know here:
